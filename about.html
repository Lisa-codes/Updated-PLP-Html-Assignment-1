    <h1>About Lisa</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Lisa Njeri &#x1f44b, a dedicated Software Developer <br>
         driven by a passion for seamlessly integrating creativity into <br>
    functional designs. With a self-driven and inquisitive nature, <br>
    I continuously seek to expand my knowledge and stay <br>
    abreast of emerging conceptsâ€”an enthusiasm complemented <br>
     by my avid reading habit. My journey into technology and coding <br>
    stems from a longstanding creative streak, where I've chosen <br>
    to channel my artistic inclination. Beyond my professional <br>
    pursuits, I find joy in occasional outdoor adventures, <br>
     exercise routines, and the pleasures of reading and writing. &#x1f600 <br>
